What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates .git filder for git related files and we need to do it because the folder is a git repository
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an intermediate area between working directory and repository. I think this is necessarey for multiple files commits.
